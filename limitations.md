# ðŸš§ Limitations

## Time limit

Every glide has a timeout limit of 1000 seconds.

## Parallel execution count limit

Every user can run only one glide in parallel.

## Output limit

Every glide's output size is limited to 200KB.

## Python limitations

Note that the Python environment is very strictly sandboxed and does not have all of the built-in functions and features.

## Mainnet query limitation

Every user can query testnet contracts, but to access the mainnet queries, the researcher needs to submit 3 unique critical vulnerability queries to the community Glider [repo](https://github.com/Hexens/glider-query-db).
