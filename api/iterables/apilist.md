# APIList

A `APIList` integrates classic list operations with advanced features. It allows functions to be applied to all elements, enables list refinement using `filter()` function, and includes a fallback mechanism to ensure default behavior when no transformations or filtering are applied.&#x20;

### APIList Functionality

A `APIList` supports all classic `list` operation, such as indexing, iteration, and length calculations. Functions called on the list are applied to every element, resulting a new `APIList` with the processed data.

### The `filter()` function

The `filter()` function uses a predicate to evaluate each element of the `APIList`. Elements where the predicate returns `true` are retained, while others are excluded, allowing precise control over the final list content.

### Flattening

When a function return another `APIList`, the results are flattened into a single, one-dimensional `APIList`. This ensures a unified list structure, facilitating easier processing and analysis.
