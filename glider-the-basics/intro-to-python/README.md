# Intro to Python

## Introduction

Before we dive into Glider, this module will introduce you to several Python fundamental concepts needed to understand how to write Glider queries with ease. If you’re new to Python, this guide will help you build a solid foundation before moving forward.

This section is broken up into two pages:

• **The Basics**: Learn about different data types, variables, and functions.

• **Advanced Python**: Learn about classes, Glider API functions, and lists.

Throughout this section, we’ll explore Python through the lens of our foundational query - a query that illustrates key Python concepts and serves as a reference when writing other Glider queries.&#x20;

If you’re already comfortable with Python, feel free to skip ahead to the [Getting Started - Basics](../intro-to-glider.md) section. Otherwise, let’s get started!
