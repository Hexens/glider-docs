# Functions

## Introduction

In this section, we will explore Functions in Solidity. Functions contain groups of related code and operate similarly to those in other programming languages.

Querying for functions is essential for identifying code patterns, making them one of the most effective starting points when analyzing Solidity contracts. Whether you’re conducting security research, code audits, or code usage, functions provide valuable clues for building precise Glider queries.

## **Section Breakdown**

This section is divided into two pages:

* **Learning Functions**
  * **What Are Functions?** - Understand the role of functions in Solidity.
  * **Breaking Down a Functions Query** - Analyze a practical example of an Function-focused query.
  * **Reviewing the Query Results** - Review and interpret the query results.
* **Exercises** - Apply what you’ve learned through hands-on exercises.\
