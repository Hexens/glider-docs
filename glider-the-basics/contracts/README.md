# Contracts

## Introduction

In this section, we will explore Contracts in Solidity. A contract represents a smart contract deployed on the blockchain and acts similarly to classes in other programming languages.

Contracts represent an entire feature or product within a given protocol, making them a powerful query target. By learning how to query contracts, you’ll be able to target specific protocols, well-known implementations, and more.

## **Section Breakdown**

This section is divided into two pages:

* **Learning Contracts**
  * **What Are Contracts?** - Understanding the role of Solidity contracts.
  * **Breaking Down a Contract Query** - Analyze a practical example of an Contract-focused query.
  * **Reviewing the Query Results** - Review and interpret the query results.
* **Exercises** - Apply what you’ve learned through hands-on exercises.

Let's get started!
