# Instructions

## Introduction

In this section, we will explore Instructions, one of the most fundamental components of Solidity code. At its simplest level, an instruction represents a single line of code.

Understanding how to query for instructions is essential for building a strong foundation in writing Glider queries. Mastering this concept will enable you to perform security analysis, code auditing, and code exploration with Glider.
