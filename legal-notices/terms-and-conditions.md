## PLATFORM <a href="#platform" id="platform"></a>

To start using the Platform, the User must either:

(a) access a Program as a prospective Security Researcher for review and to evaluate a Program. The prospective Security Researcher need not register on the Platform at this stage, however, accessing a Program will constitute the prospective Security Researcher’s acceptance of these Terms of Use; or

(b) register on the Platform as a Project or as a Security Researcher. There are two options available for Users of the Platform either:

* (i) as a Project in search of cybersecurity services; or
* as a Security Researcher or who can assist Projects in identifying vulnerabilities in their Programs, providing Reports and whom can receive a Bounty for the provision of their Services.

During the registration process, in order to comply with our legal obligations such as Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing rules and regulations, the Company may, at its sole discretion, require a User to provide necessary documentation and undergo KYC procedures before granting access to the Platform. If the User refuses to undergo such a process, the Platform reserves the right to block or terminate the use of the Platform to that User.

The Project may require Security Researchers to go through an additional KYC process, if such requirement is specified in the Program information and the Security Researcher agrees to participate in the Program under such conditions.

Subject to the prior confirmation by the Company, the Project may delegate the implementation of the Security Researcher’s additional KYC process to the Company, and if agreed so in advance between the Company and the Project, upon the completion of the KYC process, the Company shares the KYC results with the Project. In case of such a delegation, the Project may transfer the entire Bounty to the Platform, which will then handle the distribution accordingly.

By submitting the Program to the Platform, the Project accepts and agrees that the Asset will be publicly available and any Security Researcher can audit the Asset, except for the Private Programs, in which case the Project itself selects the Security Researcher. The Project shall provide an indicative range in respect of the potential Bounty which a Security Researcher may earn (**Indicative Bounty Range**).

To be eligible for a Bounty, the Report must comply with all the pre-defined conditions of the Program and the bugs in the Report should not have already been submitted by another Security Researcher to the Project (such discovery does not deprive the latter Security Researcher of being eligible for the Bounty, if the severity level is higher than that reported by the initial Security Researcher). If the submitted Report is out of scope, the Bounty payment is at the sole discretion of the Project. The Project implements the suggestions made in the Report at its own risk.

Before accepting the Report, the Project has the right to require Proof of Concept and additional information on the bugs found. The Security Researcher must provide Proof of Concept in all cases for bugs with a high and/or critical severity. In addition, where a Security Researcher identifies a bug which a Project has previously been notified of and the Security Researcher ascribes a higher severity level than previously ascribed, the Security Researcher must provide a Proof of Concept in order to be eligible for a Bounty.

The Project may request the Security Researcher to retest the Asset. Such a request will be mandatory for the Security Researcher if it was explicitly provided in the Program as an eligibility criterion for the Bounty. However, even if not required by the Program listed, it is best-practice for the Security Researcher to process a Retest.

All communication between the Security Researcher and the Project must be conducted through the chat feature of the Platform. Any communication concerning the Programs published on the Platform conducted outside of the Platform will be considered a breach of the Terms of Use and the Platform shall have no liability to any party in respect of any loss suffered as a result of communications outside the Platform chat feature. The Company does not guarantee the security or functionality of third-party software or technology and is not liable for any losses of any sort due to the failure or malfunction of third-party software or technology utilised by a User.

The Security Researcher assumes complete responsibility for any harm caused to the Project or the Platform due to tort or negligence. It is strictly prohibited to disclose any details of private programs to others. While collaboration is allowed for auditing public programs, working as a team is not permitted for private programs, unless the Project has confirmed otherwise.

## SERVICES <a href="#services" id="services"></a>

The Platform may, in its sole discretion, review a Report before submitting it to the Project to filter the information and check the compatibility of the Report with the pre-defined program requirements. In the event that a Project intends to pay a Bounty outside the Indicative Bounty Range, they must provide written reasons for the level of the proposed Bounty to the Security Researcher and the Platform.

The bug severity mentioned in the Report can be contested by the Project. If both parties do not reach an agreement, they may refer the Report to the Platform for the Triage Services and/or Mediation Services. The Platform shall provide a description of bug severity through means of a separate report and/or changing status, and/or in written form or another means of communication. Such documents have only an advisory nature and the Users are not bound by the definitions, descriptions, or decisions provided by the Platform until such time as these Terms of Use are updated. The Triage Services and related report are not binding on the parties and in the event of a continued dispute following the issue of the report, the parties may instruct a third party to settle the dispute.

The Security Researcher may request the Platform to provide Mediation between the Users. If the Project refuses to pay the Bounty in the Indicative Bounty Range in full to the eligible Security Researcher the Platform and/or the Security Researcher reserves the right to publish the case of the Project but will not publish the underlying report. The Project shall be given 45 days to consider making the payment of the Bounty following notification by the Platform or the Security Researcher or to provide written reasons of its refusal to pay the Bounty to the Security Researcher. If the Project does not make the payment within 30 calendar days from the moment of deciding to pay the Bounty or does not provide any decision on the Report within the given 45 days or, at the sole discretion of the Platform, gives inadequate reasons for its refusal to pay the Bounty, the Platform reserves the right to take other measures at its disposal, including but not limited to the termination, suspension, blocking or freezing of access to the Platform for the Project and any affiliated users, entities, partnerships or other legal personality. The Project agrees that in case of non-payment of the Bounty in full, the Security Researcher as the owner of the report, has the right to publicly disclose the Report, including its details, findings, and any associated Proof of Concept, without any restrictions or limitations after expiration of a 45 day period or, in the sole discretion of the Security Researcher, to authorise the Platform to release the Report.

If the bug presented in the Report has been previously disclosed to the Project by another Security Researcher, the Security Researcher will not be eligible for Bounty. However, the Project must provide written proof that such discovery was known previously. If the previous Report was submitted through the Platform, upon the request of the Project or Security Researcher the Platform may provide evidence from the Chat conversation through the Platform proving the previous discovery along with the proof of the unchanged conversation. The Project is required to provide evidence that proves the earlier submission of discovery if it was reported through another source. This evidence can include clear screenshots or any other means that establish the existence of the prior report. The Project must demonstrate that the reported issue was already identified and acknowledged, ensuring transparency and fairness in the bug-handling process.

If the Security Researcher, who is not registered on the Platform, found a bug in the Asset, which was not previously known to the Project, and wants to submit a Report, the Platform may mediate for the Bounty payment to the Security Researcher.

A Project may, in their sole discretion, define additional terms and rules for the Program including but not limited to pay-outs. If the Security Researcher undertakes the testing and provides a Report, they shall be deemed to have accepted the additional terms and rules when providing a Report.

## BOUNTIES AND COMMISSIONS <a href="#bounties-and-commissions" id="bounties-and-commissions"></a>

The Project rewards a Bounty to the Security Researcher who submits a Report meeting all the pre-defined requirements of the Program. The Project may reduce the level of the Bounty within the Indicative Bounty Range at its sole discretion however, a decrease in the level of the Indicative Bounty Range shall only be effective from the point of change and, for the avoidance of doubt, any Report submitted prior to the reduction in the level of the Indicative Bounty Range shall be subject to the original Indicative Bounty Range and not the reduced range. The reduction in the Indicative Bounty Range must be notified by the Project to the Security Researcher via the Platform.

The default payment process is the Project directly transferring the Bounty to the Security Researcher and separately transferring the commission to the Platform. Upon the Platform’s prior consent as part of its Services, the Project may transfer the entire Bounty to the Platform, which will then handle the distribution accordingly. The Platform will make its best efforts to process payments promptly; however, it is not responsible for any delays in payment that are beyond its reasonable control or any payments to incorrect accounts based on the provision of incorrect information by a User.

The Project agrees to pay Commission for the Platform’s Services in the amount and terms provided by the Platform.

In case a bug is discovered by a Security Researcher not registered on the Platform and the Platform may mediate the payment of a Bounty, the Commission to be paid by the Project to the Platform is provided on the Platform.

## UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR FOR SECURITY EXPERTS: <a href="#unethical-behavior-for-security-experts" id="unethical-behavior-for-security-experts"></a>

Security Researchers must conduct themselves ethically and in accordance with the rules and guidelines of the Platform. Unethical behaviour by Security Researchers includes, but is not limited to:

## UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR FOR PROJECTS: <a href="#unethical-behavior-for-projects" id="unethical-behavior-for-projects"></a>

Projects must conduct themselves ethically and in accordance with the rules and guidelines of the Platform. Unethical behaviour by Projects includes, but is not limited to:

* Abusing the mediation request system to unjustly influence or manipulate the bug bounty process.
* Routing Around the Platform: Attempting to bypass or communicate outside of the designated Platform, which can lead to unfair negotiations, bribery, or other forms of unethical behaviour.
* Claiming a bug report is a well-known or duplicate issue without clear evidence, with the intention of preventing the legitimate reporting and rewarding of a valid bug report.
* Paying Security Researchers who submit Reports outside of the Platform in order to avoid paying the Platform's commission or to incentivize unethical behaviour.
* Publicly disclosing the Report before the vulnerability has been fixed and the Security Researcher has been compensated.
* Soliciting Security Researcher hackers on the Platform for commercial projects or private bug bounty programs, which is a violation of the Platform's policies and can lead to conflicts of interest.
* Conducting attacks or providing biased feedback based on personal characteristics such as race, gender, religion, or sexual orientation, which is considered unethical behaviour.
* Engaging in deceptive or dishonest communication with Security Researchers, such as misrepresenting the severity of a vulnerability or the status of a report.
* Shutting down a Report without offering comprehensive details and/or proof as to why it should be terminated.
* Promoting any of the above behaviours or other forms of unethical behaviour, which is a violation of the Platform's policies and can result in the suspension or termination of the account.

## DISCLAIMERS AND WARRANTIES <a href="#disclaimers-and-warranties" id="disclaimers-and-warranties"></a>

The Platform upholds ethical standards and emphasizes that any instances of unethical behaviour, whether within or outside the Platform, will be taken seriously. If the Platform becomes aware of such behaviour, it reserves the right in its sole discretion to disable the User involved.

The Content and terms of the Program, as well as these terms, the design or functionalities of the Platform, may be changed/modified at any time and the Platform will do its best to keep the Content up to date. The Platform is not obligated to notify Security Researchers /Projects of any changes. The User is expected to check this page each time it accesses this Platform, so it is aware of any changes as they are binding on the User.

The Company is not responsible for the accuracy, correctness, or completeness of any information, materials, or documents available through or in relation to the Platform. It is the responsibility of the Security Researcher to ensure the accuracy of their reports and the Project to verify the validity of the reported vulnerabilities.

The Company does not endorse any Security Researcher. The Company is not responsible for any damage or harm resulting from a User’s communications or interactions with other Users, either through the Services or otherwise. Any selection or use of any Security Researcher is at the User’s own risk.

Security Researchers are not employees, contractors, or agents of the Company, but are independent third parties who want to participate in the provision of Services and connect with Projects through the Services. Unless otherwise expressly agreed to in writing by the Company, the Project agrees that any legal remedy that the Project seeks to obtain for actions or omissions of a Security Researcher regarding the Project’s program or Security Researcher’s Report will be limited to a claim against the particular Security Researcher. Any contract or other interaction between a Project and a Security Researcher, including with respect to any Project policy, will be between the Project and the Security Researcher. The Company is not a party to such contracts and disclaims all liability arising from or related to such contracts.

The Program assumes complete responsibility for addressing and resolving reported bugs, as well as accepting the Reports. The Program acknowledges that bug reports are generated by humans, and even with thorough triage and multiple reviews, the possibility of bugs persisting cannot be entirely eliminated. The bug bounty process, including triage and reviews, serves as an additional layer for ensuring the security of projects.

The Platform reserves the right to review each Program and Report before publishing it on the Platform and may decide not to publish the Program at its sole discretion.

Each party involved in the bug bounty program is responsible for the entirety of any costs and/or taxes associated with their respective roles. The Program is responsible for any taxes arising from the transfer of the Bounty, and it shall fulfil this obligation accordingly. If the regulations of the Security Researcher necessitate taxes, the Security Researcher shall bear those tax obligations. The Company is responsible for any applicable taxes on its Commissions.

The Platform reserves the right to disable any username, or password, to restrict, suspend, or terminate the access of Users to the Platform or any part of the Platform or any of its features at any time at the sole discretion of the Platform for any or no reason without any prior notice. The Platform also reserves the right to take appropriate legal action and cooperate with law enforcement authorities in case of any illegal or unauthorized behaviour.

The Platform does not provide any warranty for the cooperation between the Users, including for the payment of the Bounty. The Platform will investigate and address reported vulnerabilities, but the Platform bears no responsibility for any loss, damage, or harm, resulting from the communication or interaction between the Security Researcher and the Project, including accepting and implementing the Report suggested by the Security Researcher.

Users acknowledge that they act on the Platform at their own risk and that the Company is not responsible for any damages or losses that may result from a User’s participation on the Platform.

By using the Services and/or the Platform, Users warrant to hold harmless the Company, its subsidiaries, directors, partners, employees, contractors, or agents from any claims resulting from any action taken by the Users. The Platform provides the ability for Users to interact with various decentralized finance protocols. However, it’s important to note the Platform has no control over the subsequent interactions or transactions, and it is the sole responsibility of Users to assess the risks and choose to deploy their digital assets onto such protocols. The operation of these protocols may involve complex blockchain technologies that require an in-depth understanding of digital assets, cybersecurity, and related technologies. The platform is open access, meaning that anyone can access it. As a User, it is crucial to have a complete understanding of the Platform and the associated risks, which include but are not limited to the potential forfeiture or loss of your digital assets. The Platform enables two Users to interact. The Platform and/or the Company accepts no responsibility for any losses suffered by any User in respect of their relationship with another User.
