## PLATFORM <a href="#platform" id="platform"></a>

To start using the Platform, the User must either:

(a) access a Program as a prospective Security Researcher for review and to evaluate a Program. The prospective Security Researcher need not register on the Platform at this stage, however, accessing a Program will constitute the prospective Security Researcher‚Äôs acceptance of these Terms of Use; or

(b) register on the Platform as a Project or as a Security Researcher. There are two options available for Users of the Platform either:

* (i) as a Project in search of cybersecurity services; or
* as a Security Researcher or who can assist Projects in identifying vulnerabilities in their Programs, providing Reports and whom can receive a Bounty for the provision of their Services.



During the registration process, in order to comply with our legal obligations such as Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing rules and regulations, the Company may, at its sole discretion, require a User to provide necessary documentation and undergo KYC procedures before granting access to the Platform. If the User refuses to undergo such a process, the Platform reserves the right to block or terminate the use of the Platform to that User.

The Project may require Security Researchers to go through an additional KYC process, if such requirement is specified in the Program information and the Security Researcher agrees to participate in the Program under such conditions.&#x20;

By submitting the Program to the Platform, the Project accepts and agrees that the Asset will be publicly available and any Security Researcher can audit the Asset, except for the Private Programs, in which case the Project itself selects the Security Researcher. The Project shall provide an indicative range in respect of the potential Bounty which a Security Researcher may earn (**Indicative Bounty Range**).

To be eligible for a Bounty, the Report must comply with all the pre-defined conditions of the Program and the bugs in the Report should not have already been submitted by another Security Researcher to the Project (such discovery does not deprive the latter Security Researcher of being eligible for the Bounty, if the severity level is higher than that reported by the initial Security Researcher). If the submitted Report is out of scope, the Bounty payment is at the sole discretion of the Project. The Project implements the suggestions made in the Report at its own risk.&#x20;

Before accepting the Report, the Project has the right to require Proof of Concept and additional information on the bugs found. The Security Researcher must provide Proof of Concept in all cases for bugs with a high and/or critical severity. In addition, where a Security Researcher identifies a bug which a Project has previously been notified of and the Security Researcher ascribes a higher severity level than previously ascribed, the Security Researcher must provide a Proof of Concept in order to be eligible for a Bounty.

The Project may request the Security Researcher to retest the Asset. Such a request will be mandatory for the Security Researcher if it was explicitly provided in the Program as an eligibility criterion for the Bounty. However, even if not required by the Program listed, it is best-practice for the Security Researcher to process a Retest.

All communication between the Security Researcher and the Project must be conducted through the chat feature of the Platform. Any communication concerning the Programs published on the Platform conducted outside of the Platform will be considered a breach of the Terms of Use and the Platform shall have no liability to any party in respect of any loss suffered as a result of communications outside the Platform chat feature. The Company does not guarantee the security or functionality of third-party software or technology and is not liable for any losses of any sort due to the failure or malfunction of third-party software or technology utilised by a User.

The Security Researcher assumes complete responsibility for any harm caused to the Project or the Platform due to tort or negligence. It is strictly prohibited to disclose any details of private programs to others. While collaboration is allowed for auditing public programs, working as a team is not permitted for private programs, unless the Project has confirmed otherwise.

## SERVICES <a href="#services" id="services"></a>

The Platform may, in its sole discretion, review a Report before submitting it to the Project to filter the information and check the compatibility of the Report with the pre-defined program requirements. In the event that a Project intends to pay a Bounty outside the Indicative Bounty Range, they must provide written reasons for the level of the proposed Bounty to the Security Researcher and the Platform.&#x20;

The bug severity mentioned in the Report can be contested by the Project. If both parties do not reach an agreement, they may refer the Report to the Platform for the Triage Services and/or Mediation Services. The Platform shall provide a description of bug severity through means of a separate report and/or changing status, and/or in written form or another means of communication. Such documents have only an advisory nature and the Users are not bound by the definitions, descriptions, or decisions provided by the Platform until such time as these Terms of Use are updated. The Triage Services and related report are not binding on the parties and in the event of a continued dispute following the issue of the report, the parties may instruct a third party to settle the dispute.&#x20;

The Security Researcher may request the Platform to provide Mediation between the Users. If the Project refuses to pay the Bounty in the Indicative Bounty Range in full to the eligible Security Researcher the Platform and/or the Security Researcher reserves the right to publish the case of the Project but will not publish the underlying report. The Project shall be given 45 days to consider making the payment of the Bounty following notification by the Platform or the Security Researcher or to provide written reasons of its refusal to pay the Bounty to the Security Researcher. If the Project does not make the payment at the expiry of the 45 day period or, in the sole discretion of the Platform, gives inadequate reasons for its refusal to pay the Bounty, the Platform reserves the right to take other measures at its disposal, including but not limited to the termination, suspension, blocking or freezing of access to the Platform for the Project and any affiliated users, entities, partnerships or other legal personality. The Project agrees that in case of non-payment of the Bounty in full, the Security Researcher as the owner of the report, has the right to publicly disclose the Report, including its details, findings, and any associated Proof of Concept, without any restrictions or limitations after expiration of a 45 day period or, in the sole discretion of the Security Researcher, to authorise the Platform to release the Report.

If the bug presented in the Report has been previously disclosed to the Project by another Security Researcher, the Security Researcher will not be eligible for Bounty. However, the Project must provide written proof that such discovery was known previously. If the previous Report was submitted through the Platform, upon the request of the Project or Security Researcher the Platform may provide evidence from the Chat conversation through the Platform proving the previous discovery along with the proof of the unchanged conversation. The Project is required to provide evidence that proves the earlier submission of discovery if it was reported through another source. This evidence can include clear screenshots or any other means that establish the existence of the prior report. The Project must demonstrate that the reported issue was already identified and acknowledged, ensuring transparency and fairness in the bug-handling process.

If the Security Researcher, who is not registered on the Platform, found a bug in the Asset, which was not previously known to the Project, and wants to submit a Report, the Platform may mediate for the Bounty payment to the Security Researcher.&#x20;

A Project may, in their sole discretion, define additional terms and rules for the Program including but not limited to pay-outs. If the Security Researcher undertakes the testing and provides a Report, they shall be deemed to have accepted the additional terms and rules when providing a Report.

## BOUNTIES AND COMMISSIONS <a href="#bounties-and-commissions" id="bounties-and-commissions"></a>

The Project rewards a Bounty to the Security Researcher who submits a Report meeting all the pre-defined requirements of the Program. The Project may reduce the level of the Bounty within the Indicative Bounty Range at its sole discretion however, a decrease in the level of the Indicative Bounty Range shall only be effective from the point of change and, for the avoidance of doubt, any Report submitted prior to the reduction in the level of the Indicative Bounty Range shall be subject to the original Indicative Bounty Range and not the reduced range. The reduction in the Indicative Bounty Range must be notified by the Project to the Security Researcher via the Platform.

The payment process will be carried out according to two possible scenarios at the sole discretion of the Project:&#x20;

* (i) The Project may choose to directly transfer the Bounty to the Security Researcher and separately transfer the commission to the Platform; or
* The Project may transfer the entire Bounty to the Platform, which will then handle the distribution accordingly. The Platform will make its best efforts to process payments promptly; however, it is not responsible for any delays in payment that are beyond its reasonable control or any payments to incorrect accounts based on the provision of incorrect information by a User.

The Project agrees to pay Commission for the Platform‚Äôs Services in the amount and terms provided by the Platform.

In case a bug is discovered by a Security Researcher not registered on the Platform and the Platform may mediate the payment of a Bounty, the Commission to be paid by the Project to the Platform is provided on the Platform.&#x20;

## UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR FOR SECURITY EXPERTS:

Security Researchers must conduct themselves ethically and in accordance with the rules and guidelines of the Platform. Unethical behaviour by Security Researchers includes, but is not limited to:

* Begging for a Bounty reward that is not owed to the Security Researcher based on the terms of the Program.
* Requesting gas fees from the Platform or the Project.
* Disputing a Report after it has been paid or marked as closed, except for requesting mediation.
* Advertising or promoting services on the Platform or to the Project.
* Conducting attacks based on personal characteristics, such as race, gender, religion, or sexual orientation.
* Testing with live or public testnet contracts without permission from the Project.
* Falsely claiming that a bug report affects an Asset in scope when it does not.
* Exaggerating the severity of a Report to receive a higher Bounty pay-out.
* Creating multiple accounts on the Platform to circumvent rules or increase rewards.
* Underreporting or misrepresenting vulnerabilities to receive a higher Bounty.&#x20;
* Revealing the Report or its existence to the public before the Project has addressed and compensated it and fixed the bugs revealed in the report.
* Revealing the Report to the public before 45 days have passed since the Project determined it was out of scope or did not require a fix.
* Revealing a Report that is considered a duplicate or already known to the Project.
* Revealing a valid Report which was accepted by the Project and for which the Bounty was paid without the prior written confirmation of the Project.
* Providing the Project with a Report that lacks specific information, clear steps to reproduce, or a demonstration of the issue when requested.
* Submitting Reports that are considered spam or of low quality, or information that is not relevant to a bug report on the Platform.
* Conducting automated testing that generates excessive traffic on the Project's platform.
* Attempting to exploit, attack, or threaten to exploit/attack the project on the Platform.
* Phishing or conducting other social engineering attacks against the Project or the Platform.
* Engaging in harassment or abusive communication with the Project or the Platform or other Security Researchers.
* Pretending to be other Security Researchers.&#x20;
* Threatening violence against the Project, Platform or any of its members and other Security Researchers.
* Threatening to publish or publishing people's personal information without their consent.
* Engaging in extortion, blackmail, or threats of extortion/blackmail against the Project or any of its members.
* Publishing content that violates the law or when communicating with the Project.
* Reporting a bug that has already been publicly disclosed.
* Submitting Reports that were generated by AI or automated scanners.
* Contributing fixes to the Project's repository without obtaining explicit permission.
* Disclosing or accessing sensitive information beyond what is necessary to submit the bug report or conduct mediation.

## UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR FOR PROJECTS: <a href="#unethical-behavior-for-projects" id="unethical-behavior-for-projects"></a>

Projects must conduct themselves ethically and in accordance with the rules and guidelines of the Platform. Unethical behaviour by Projects includes, but is not limited to:

* Abusing the mediation request system to unjustly influence or manipulate the bug bounty process.
* Routing Around the Platform: Attempting to bypass or communicate outside of the designated Platform, which can lead to unfair negotiations, bribery, or other forms of unethical behaviour.
* Claiming a bug report is a well-known or duplicate issue without clear evidence, with the intention of preventing the legitimate reporting and rewarding of a valid bug report.
* Paying Security Researchers who submit Reports outside of the Platform in order to avoid paying the Platform's commission or to incentivize unethical behaviour.
* Publicly disclosing the Report before the vulnerability has been fixed and the Security Researcher has been compensated.&#x20;
* Soliciting Security Researcher hackers on the Platform for commercial projects or private bug bounty programs, which is a violation of the Platform's policies and can lead to conflicts of interest.
* Conducting attacks or providing biased feedback based on personal characteristics such as race, gender, religion, or sexual orientation, which is considered unethical behaviour.
* Engaging in deceptive or dishonest communication with Security Researchers, such as misrepresenting the severity of a vulnerability or the status of a report.
* Shutting down a Report without offering comprehensive details and/or proof as to why it should be terminated.
* Promoting any of the above behaviours or other forms of unethical behaviour, which is a violation of the Platform's policies and can result in the suspension or termination of the account.

## DISCLAIMERS AND WARRANTIES <a href="#disclaimers-and-warranties" id="disclaimers-and-warranties"></a>

The Platform upholds ethical standards and emphasizes that any instances of unethical behaviour, whether within or outside the Platform, will be taken seriously. If the Platform becomes aware of such behaviour, it reserves the right in its sole discretion to disable the User involved.&#x20;

Unless otherwise expressly agreed to in writing by the Company, the Project agrees that any legal remedy that the Project seeks to obtain for actions or omissions of a Security Researcher regarding the Project‚Äôs program or Security Researcher‚Äôs Report will be limited to a claim against the particular Security Researcher. Any contract or other interaction between a Project and a Security Researcher, including with respect to any Project policy, will be between the Project and the Security Researcher. The Company is not a party to such contracts and disclaims all liability arising from or related to such contracts.

The Program assumes complete responsibility for addressing and resolving reported bugs, as well as accepting the Reports. The Program acknowledges that bug reports are generated by humans, and even with thorough triage and multiple reviews, the possibility of bugs persisting cannot be entirely eliminated. The bug bounty process, including triage and reviews, serves as an additional layer for ensuring the security of projects.

The Platform reserves the right to review each Program and Report before publishing it on the Platform and may decide not to publish the Program at its sole discretion.

Each party involved in the bug bounty program is responsible for the entirety of any costs and/or taxes associated with their respective roles.

Glider is a comprehensive tool that provides a range of services tailored to meet the needs of Security Researchers and developers, Projects and Organizations. Our offerings are designed to enhance security, streamline vulnerability detection, and promote collaboration within the community. Below is an overview of the key services offered by Glider:

* **Semantic Code Analysis Engine**: Glider's flagship service is its cutting-edge semantic code analysis engine. Renowned for its industry-leading capabilities, this engine revolutionizes vulnerability detection by allowing Users to query code as though it were data. With Glider's semantic analysis, Security Researchers can craft precise queries to uncover various vulnerabilities and coding errors, do data analytics, ensuring robust security for software projects.

By leveraging Glider's platform, developers can identify and address security vulnerabilities more effectively, contributing to the overall security of the web3 ecosystem.

At our discretion, we reserve the right to limit access to codebases, restricting them to testnet only or a portion of mainnet. It's important to note that mainnet represents the live and real-time environment, while testnet lacks any real-world value and is primarily used for testing purposes, thus minimizing potential risks associated with security breaches.

* **Custom Query Development**: Glider empowers Security Researchers to develop and test custom queries tailored to their specific needs. Whether it's addressing unique security challenges or refining existing queries, Glider provides the tools and resources necessary to develop high-quality custom queries for vulnerability detection and code analysis.
* **Code Scanning Alerts**: Through Glider's code scanning alerts feature, Users can generate alerts based on the results of code scanning analyses. These alerts provide valuable insights into potential security vulnerabilities and coding errors, enabling developers to take proactive measures to mitigate risks and enhance the security of their codebases.
* **Community Collaboration**: Glider fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing within the security community. Users can share their queries, insights, and best practices with the broader community, facilitating collaboration and collective learning. By harnessing the collective intelligence and creativity of the community, Glider aims to establish security as a fundamental pillar of the digital experience.
